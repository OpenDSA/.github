Welcome to the OpenDSA eTextbook GitHub Organization!

OpenDSA is organized to support installation using Docker. If you would like to install your own copy, there are two ways to go.
#. Install the full DevStack. This includes the OpenDSA server, the OpenDSA content repository, the database, and everything necessary to run a full system. See the instructions in the OpenDSA-DevStack repository README.
#. Install just the content repository. This provides enough infrastructure to create book content and compile books locally, or for "standa-alone" mode for use as reference material. "Stand-alone" books include fully operational exercises, but they do not link to an LMS or other mechanism for remembering users and tracking scores. See the instructions in the OpenDSA repository README.
